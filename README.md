This is a repository made to store verilog code files that i write throught my Computer Engineering graduation at Universidade Federal 
da Bahia (UFBA).

Because of this, most of the code found in here will initially be of a beginner level, as i'm starting to learn this HDL. 

Anyway, feel free to tell me anything you want about this repo!
